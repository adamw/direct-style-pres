# Caveats

* JVM-only

* Native possible?

* What do we loose comparing to `IO`s:
  * safe interruptions
  * (partially) safe resources
  * (partially) error handling
  * uniformly-lazy
  * referential transparency

* What do we gain:
  * low syntax overhead
  * simplicity
  * interoperability w/ any direct-style Java library
  * useful stack traces
  * no function coloring
  * structured concurrency
