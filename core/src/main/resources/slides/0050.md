# Direct Scala Stack

* Loom introduced an asynchronous runtime into the JVM

* the original rationale behind `IO`s went away
  * what's left? see my [Scala.IO talk](https://adamw.github.io/unwrapping-io/)

* the world moved forward
  * Scala has a lot to offer: the best & only commercially-used FP+OOP language
  * but some use-cases require new stacks to stay relevant

Going forward:

## How can we support the execution of applications written in direct style using Scala?
