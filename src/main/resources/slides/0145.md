# Ideal method signature 

```scala
def queryLLM(question: Question)(using IO): Either[LLMError, Answer] = ???

// if all errors are handled, should the signature still include the IO capability?
def answer(question: Question): Either[LLMError, Answer] =
  IO.unsafe {
    try queryLLM(question)
    catch case NonFatal(e) => Right("42")
  }
```
