# Ideal method signature 

```scala
// other capabilities

// Ox: capability to create forks in the current concurrency scope
def startEmailSender(using Ox): Sink[Email] = ???

// State: capability to modify global state
def increaseRateLimit(using State): Unit = ???

// IO: capability to perform IO
def writeToFile(file: File, content: String)(using IO): Unit = ???

// Async: capability to suspend
def fetchFromCacheOrAPI(using Async): Answer = ???
```

`State`, `IO`: verified by a compiler plugin?
